<font size="+2">How to implement your own visitor (Implementation of your proprietary algorithm) that can easily run inside DataFrame</font><BR><BR>
DataFrame visitors have a very simple interface that you can follow. To see examples of built-in visitors, look at the file <I>DataFrameStatsVisitors.h</I>.<BR>
These are the interfaces you must have:
  <UL>
    <LI>It is helpful if you include file <I>DataFrameStatsVisitors.h</I> in your new visitor source file. It includes some macros you can use.</LI>
    <LI>A visitor at its heart is a functor:</LI>
      <UL>
        <LI>You must declare a struct or class with an appropriate name for your visitor. If your visitor needs parameters, take them in the functor constructor.</LI>
        <LI>Your functor must publicly declare the <I>operator()()</I>. The number of parameters to the <I>()</I> operator depends on your algorithm and what you are implementing. The first pair of parameters to <I>()</I> operator is always the begin and end iterators of the index vector. After that you have pairs of begin/end iterators to the data vectors. DataFrame supports visitors that operate on 1 to 5 data columns. DataFrame calls this operator to pass the data. Your algorithm should be here.</LI>
        <LI>Your functor must publicly typedef the following types:</LI>
          <UL>
            <LI><I>index_type</I>: This defines the index column type</LI>
            <LI><I>value_type</I>: This defines the data column(s) type. If you have multiple data columns of different types, define it for the first one</LI>
            <LI><I>result_type</I>: This defines the type of your algorithm result. The result could be an item or a container of items or â€¦ If you have multiple result types, define it for the first/main one.</LI>
          </UL>
        <LI>Your functor must publicly define the following member functions:</LI>
          <UL>
            <LI><I>void pre()</I>: This is called by DataFrame before passing data to your visitor. You can initialize the process here. And/or reset the process here for repeated use of the same visitor instance.</LI>
            <LI><I>void post()</I>: This is called by DataFrame after it finishes with passing data to your visitor. You can finalize the process here.</LI>
            <LI><I>const result_type &amp;get_result() const</I>: This returns the result of your algorithm. If you have multiple results, define this for the first/main result.</LI>
            <LI><I>result_type &amp;get_result()</I>: non-const version of above, if applicable.</LI>
          </UL>
      </UL>
    <LI>Your visitor will be used by DataFrame's <I>visit()</I> or <I>signle_act_visit()</I> methods.</LI>
  </UL>
