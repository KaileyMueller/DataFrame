  Containers of pointers to data are very inefficient because of two main reasons:<BR>
  <OL>
    <LI>Each pointer points to a "different" memory location.  In other words, the data is not stored contiguously. That breaks cache locality and therefore it is a major inefficiency.</LI>
    <LI>To access data through a pointer, in general, you must do two things; first you must dereference the pointer and then access the data it is pointing to. For large datasets it becomes an inefficiency.</LI>
  </OL>
