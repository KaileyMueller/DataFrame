  <I>Garbage In, Garbage Out</I> is when a user inputs a dataset that is not suitable for a particular analysis, and (s)he gets nonsense as a result. For example, a data analysis algorithm may require that the input to be normally distributed. If user inputs a dataset that is far from being normal distribution, the result will be garbage.<BR>
  One approach would be for the library to check the data first and warn the user that the data is not suitable. DataFrame doesnâ€™t do that because this approach has many pitfalls:
  <OL>
    <LI>It makes the code inefficient and slow</LI>
    <LI>It makes the code convoluted and hard to understand and maintain</LI>
    <LI>The check often is more complicated than the algorithm itself and it makes the code bug-prone</LI>
  </OL>
  DataFrame is not a teaching/educational library -- there are other legitimate libraries for that. Therefore, the DataFrame logic is; <I>if you don't know what you are doing, you deserve what you get</I>.
